# iOS Development 101: Tip Calculator

This is a simple tip calculator app that helped me to learn the basics of Xcode and Swift. For this small project, my focus was to gain an understanding of how to:

- navigate through the GUI properly to create a view
- attach an action to a click event
- label variables from view pieces
- embed an image locally
- route a user to a new page with a proper back button
- accurately space out items for multiple phone screen sizes
- and more!

That being said, please ignore the "About Me" link on the bottom or the irrelevant picture -- just part of the learning process!
